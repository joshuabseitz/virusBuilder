Project 4 - BUILDER PATTERN

For the project 4 pattern of choice, we programmed a research center which uses a researcher (director class) to find information on searches from the user (client). The program uses concrete builders to construct a factsheet on each virus, which is unique for each virus.

In order to run this program, run User.java, which can be found in the CLIENT folder.
